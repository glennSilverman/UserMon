Usermon is an example role-based user management system in Lift
that implements the new ManyToMany trait as well as ModelView and ModelSnippet
in Lift 1.1-SNAPSHOT.

Registered users can log in, create a hierarchy of roles and assign
roles to users.

The application uses asmselect, a JQuery javascript multiselect form input for
managing user roles, which has a many-to-many relationship with users.

Set up and useage:

You can use derby for your database if you must, but the program is configured for mysql, so you will
need to have a running instance of mysql. The pom includes the mysql jdbc driver as a dependency. 

Create a database schema (the default is lift_usermon) to store the
Lift mapper entities and configure for your mysql username and password, like so, 

val dbUrl: String = Props.get("db.url") openOr
    "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/lift_usermon?user=<username>&password=<password>"
    
in Boot.scala.
